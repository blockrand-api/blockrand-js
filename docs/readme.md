Randomness matters more than most people realize — especially in gaming, lotteries, and simulations. [BlockRand](https://github.com/blockrand-api/blockrand-js)  delivers provably fair, auditable random numbers that anyone can verify. By using cryptographic commit-reveal schemes, deterministic hashing, and external entropy sources, it guarantees that outcomes are unbiased and tamper-proof, giving users and developers confidence in the integrity of every result.
